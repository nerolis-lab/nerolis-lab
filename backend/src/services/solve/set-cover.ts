   * and caches the results to avoid redundant calculations.
   *
   * The function is complex due to its recursive nature and the need to handle multiple edge cases, such as:
   * - When the producer alone can solve the remaining ingredients.
   * - When there are no more spots left in the team.
   * - When a solution is found that requires fewer members than previously found solutions.
   *
   * The recursive call works by invoking the `solve` method on the remaining recipe and ingredient indices.
   * If a valid solution is found, it is cached and used to update the current list of teams.
   *
   * The recursive call ends when a solution is found and `spotsLeftInTeam` is set to 0.
   * Furthermore the solve function itself also checks for cached solutions and if the search should be stopped (timeout, etc).
